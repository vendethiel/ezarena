 <title>FreeStyle Menus Demonstration</title>

<!--

Welcome to the FreeStyle Menu script!

The menus have 4 components that you need to copy and paste into your page:
 1) A <link> tag that includes a CSS file, controling menu layout and formatting.
 2) A core <script> tag that includes the main fsmenu.js to control menu behaviour.
 3) The menu data itself, which is either a <ul> list or some <div> tags.
 4) A configuration <script> that activates the menu data.

(1) and (2) must be pasted into your document <head>, while (3) must be pasted
into your document <body>. (4) must be pasted anywhere after (2); you can even
combine the two if you want.

I suggest using server-side includes for including menu data on all pages of your site.
Try a language like PHP or ASP if your webhost supports it perhaps.

See below for menu examples; there are 2 main modes of operation for this script, using a
nested UL/LI list, and using un-nested tags in the page.
I recommend you use the list mode, but I've included an example of the other as well.

Good luck - Angus.

***** EXAMPLE 1: LIST MENU (v5+ browsers only) *****

You just need a series of <ul> lists, one nested inside another, with <a> tags in each item,
and <ul> tags after <a> tags to trigger another level of submenus.
The script will then automatically manage them as a multilevel popup menu.
Paste your data into here to get started, and be careful to close all your </li> tags!

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[

// For each menu you create, you must create a matching "FSMenu" JavaScript object to represent
// it and manage its behaviour. You don't have to edit this script at all if you don't want to;
// these comments are just here for completeness. Also, feel free to paste this script into the
// external .JS file to make including it in your pages easier!

// Here's a menu object to control the above list of menu data:
var listMenu = new FSMenu('listMenu', true, 'visibility', 'visible', 'hidden');

// The parameters of the FSMenu object are:
//  1) Its own name in quotes.
//  2) Whether this is a nested list menu or not (in this case, true means yes).
//  3) The CSS property name to change when menus are shown and hidden.
//  4) The visible value of that CSS property.
//  5) The hidden value of that CSS property.
//
// Next, here's some optional settings for delays and highlighting:
//  * showDelay is the time (in milliseconds) to display a new child menu.
//  * switchDelay is the time to switch from one child menu to another child menu.
//    Set this higher and point at 2 neighbouring items to see what it does.
//  * hideDelay is the time it takes for a menu to hide after mouseout.
//  * cssLitClass is the CSS classname applied to parent items of active menus.
//  * showOnClick will, suprisingly, set the menus to show on click. Pick one of 3 values:
//    0 = all mouseover, 1 = first level click, sublevels mouseover, 2 = all click.

//listMenu.showDelay = 0;
//listMenu.switchDelay = 125;
//listMenu.hideDelay = 500;
listMenu.cssLitClass = 'highlighted';
//listMenu.showOnClick = 1;


// Now the fun part... animation! This script supports animation plugins you can add to each
// menu object you create. Here's two to get you started. To enable animation, add one or
// more functions to the menuObject.animations array, and set menuObject.animSpeed to the
// desired percentage of animation to be completed per frame.
// Animation functions are called with a reference to the menu element being animated,
// and a counter variable that changes from 0 to 100 depending on the animation progress.

function animClipDown(ref, counter)
{
 var cP = Math.pow(Math.sin(Math.PI*counter/200),0.75);
 ref.style.clip = (counter==100 ?
  ((window.opera || navigator.userAgent.indexOf('KHTML') > -1) ? '':
   'rect(auto, auto, auto, auto)') :
    'rect(0, ' + ref.offsetWidth + 'px, '+(ref.offsetHeight*cP)+'px, 0)');
};

function animFade(ref, counter)
{
 var f = ref.filters, done = (counter==100);
 if (f)
 {
  if (!done && ref.style.filter.indexOf("alpha") == -1)
   ref.style.filter += ' alpha(opacity=' + counter + ')';
  else if (f.length && f.alpha) with (f.alpha)
  {
   if (done) enabled = false;
   else { opacity = counter; enabled=true }
  }
 }
 else ref.style.opacity = ref.style.MozOpacity = counter/100.1;

listMenu.animSpeed = 20;


// Finally, on page load you have to activate the menu by calling its 'activateMenu()' method.
// I've provided an "addEvent" method that lets you easily run page events across browsers.
// You pass the activateMenu() function two parameters:
//  (1) The ID of the outermost <ul> list tag containing your menu data.
//  (2) A node containing your submenu popout arrow indicator.
// If none of that made sense, just cut and paste this next bit for each menu you create.

var arrow = null;
if (document.createElement && document.documentElement)
{
 arrow = document.createElement('span');
 arrow.appendChild(document.createTextNode('>'));
 // Feel free to replace the above two lines with these for a small arrow image...
 //arrow = document.createElement('img');
 //arrow.src = 'arrow.gif';
 //arrow.style.borderWidth = '0';

 arrow.className = 'subind';
}

addEvent(window, 'load', new Function('listMenu.activateMenu("listMenuRoot", arrow)'));


// You may wish to leave your menu as a visible list initially, then apply its style
// dynamically on activation for better accessibility. Screenreaders and older browsers will
// then see all your menu data, but there will be a 'flicker' of the raw list before the
// page has completely loaded. If you want to do this, remove the CLASS="..." attribute from
// the above outermost UL tag, and uncomment this line:
//addEvent(window, 'load', new Function('getRef("listMenuRoot").className="menulist"'));


// To create more menus, duplicate this section and make sure you rename your
// menu object to something different; also, activate another <ul> list with a
// different ID, of course :). You can hae as many menus as you want on a page.

<!-- ***** END OF EXAMPLE 1: LIST MENU ***** -->



<div style="clear: both; height: 2em"></div>

<p>This script is a highly flexible means of converting HTML content into powerful popup menus,
using either nested lists or DIV tags for menu data, and following best practice guidelines
for powerful and accessible menus.</p>

<h4>Features:</h4>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Pure CSS formatting</strong> allows infinitely customisable menu appearance
  using the standards-based technology you know.</li>
 <li><strong>Accessible HTML elements</strong> used to construct the menus, so your site
  maintains excellent search engine and screenreader compatibility.</li>
 <li><strong>Object-orientated JavaScript</strong> for separate menu systems and easy
  implementation; you don't have to know any JavaScript to use the menus.</li>
 <li><strong>Fallback to pure CSS menus</strong> where JavaScript is disabled.</li>
 <li><strong>Hierarchial / Multilevel</strong> menus supported -- as many levels as you want!</li>
 <li>Menus are <strong>relatively positioned</strong> from their parent menu/item.</li>
 <li><strong>Plugin animation framework</strong> allows you to easily implement and
  customise animation effects for your menus.</li>
 <li><strong>Customisable show/hide timers</strong> applied to menus, so your menus
  <strong>don't have to overlap</strong>.</li>
 <li>You can <strong>mouseover neighbouring items without hiding submenus</strong>, using
  a powerful 'switch timer' option. No more of that 'slippery' menu feeling!</li>
 <li><strong>ONCLICK support</strong> is optional for menus.</li>
 <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation</strong> using standard TAB and SHIFT-TAB link focusing
  with the list-based menus.</li>
 <li><strong>Tiny, fast script</strong> since data is in the page BODY; it's as little as 7kb in
  size, so your visitors won't be kept waiting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's another example of the script: multiple DIVs used to construct a menu.
This will work in v4 browsers.</p>



<!-- ***** EXAMPLE 2: DIV MENU (v4+ browsers) ***** -->

<script type="text/javascript">
//<![CDATA[

// This menu does 'work' in v4+ browsers, but I recommend the above UL/LI menu system
// as it simpler, cleaner and more elegant.

// With this divMenu object, 'false' means the menu elements are not nested.
var divMenu = new FSMenu('divMenu', false, 'visibility', 'visible', 'hidden');
divMenu.cssLitClass = 'highlighted';

// The other optional settings and animation functions will work here too.

//]]>
</script>

<!--

Instead of activating on page load, this menu style requires event handlers in the page:

<tag onmouseover="menuObjectName.show('menuname-to-show', this, Left, Top)"
     onmouseout="menuObjectName.hide('menuname-to-hide')">

The menuname and 'this' are compulsory. If you want, you can specify the Left and Top values,
which instruct the script to popout the new menu that many pixels from 'this', the current
element, otherwise leave them out to control the positioning yourself (perhaps via CSS).

Then, you have menu elements themselves in the page, with the appropriate IDs:

<tag id="menuname-to-show">Menu Contents Here</tag>

They contain your menu data, and will be shown by the script.

<h4>Usage Instructions:</h4>
<p>Everything's in the source of this page. The JS file itself you don't need to edit, and you
can leave the demo script unchanged. You will want to open the .CSS file and change the menu
formatting there though, and of course the menu data in the BODY of the page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Good luck - Angus.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Advantages of this script</h4>

<p>The main advantages of this script over a "pure" CSS menu (that use :hover states on
elements) are that this script allows customisable show and hide delays for menus (so menus
don't feel so "slippery", disappearing at the slightest provocation) and fancier effects.
This means that your menus don't have to overlap; you can place them wherever you want.
Also, its advanced "switch timer" means that you can mouseover neighbouring items while navigating
to point at a submenu without hiding the submenu in question -- fixing a common (and accurate)
usability complaint that many people level against popup menus systems!
You don't give up compatibility though -- since this script uses pure CSS for formatting, it is
easy to include a NOSCRIPT tag that allows fallback to a pure CSS menu where JavaScript is disabled
or unsupported.
Meanwhile, with clever CSS, you can make the script degrade very well in older browsers, perhaps
to a plain nested list or the set of first-level menu items.</p>

<p>When compared to a pure JavaScript menu system (where the menu data is stored in a custom
format in a JavaScript file), this script is much more search-engine friendly and accessible to
screenreaders and older browsers, as its menu data is stored in the page's HTML content.
To enhance accessibility, test widely, and perhaps specify a MEDIA type on your stylesheet
to avoid hiding submenus in screenreaders if you feel that would benefit your site!</p>

<p>Some other JavaScript menu systems are now using list data for their menu data store.
However, they often use processing functions that copy the hidden list data to separate DIVs in
the page, managed with their own layout system. This means you can't fallback to pure CSS menus
like this script, and it may limit your formatting options -- with this script, you have the full
power of CSS to format your menus however you want.</p>

<p>Overall, I've tried to build this script with "Best Practices" in mind, using each web
technology where it's best suited: HTML for semantic data, CSS for layout and styling, and
JavaScript for controlling behaviour. I hope you find it useful!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Script Help &amp; Hints</h4>

<p>Since this is the first release, there aren't many Frequently Asked Questions yet :).</p>

<p>If you want to make this script run across frames, you can trigger menus by calling the mouseover
and mouseout events in another frame like onmouseover="parent.content.divMenu.show(....)" where
'content' is the name of the frame containing this menu script and all the menu data.
You don't need to include the JS files in the triggering frame, and this will only work with
the DIV menu version (not the list-version menus).</p>

<p>This script works best paired with an XHTML/CSS document, and a fair knowledge of CSS layout
and formatting techniques. If you're not familiar with CSS, use this as a learning opportunity,
as it's a very powerful tool!</p>

<p>To include your menus in each page of your site, it's best to use some form of include with the
menu data stored in an external file. Check to see what your webhost supports; if you have something
like PHP or Apache's Server Side Includes on your server, it's very easy, consult the appropriate
documentation or helpfiles for more info.</p>

<p>Also, the "commented" script file contains some of the code for both div and list menus. If you
are only using one type, feel free to edit it and remove the extra code; or perhaps just remove the
NS4 compatibility code at the bottom, to get an additional speedup.</p>

<h4>Extra Effects and Additions</h4>

<p>I've bundled a bunch of extra effects for this script in the <strong>fsmenu_extras.js</strong>
file included with the download. Feel free to load it up, you will find:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>&lt;SELECT&gt; Box and IFRAME Fix</strong>, to stop menus being covered in IE.</li>
 <li><strong>Menu title display</strong>, like on my website.</li>
 <li><strong>Floating menus</strong> that scroll with the page as the user drags the scrollbar.</li>
</ul>

<p>These should also serve as examples if you want to write plugins/extensions to the script
yourself. I hope you find them useful!</p>
